# Quick Reference

## File Location Cheatsheet
- Add client code → `components/clients.js`
- Add project code → `components/projects.js`
- Add order code → `components/orders.js`
- Add supplier code → `components/suppliers.js`
- Add work schedule code → `components/sidur.js`
- Add shared constants → `shared/constants.js`
- Add helper functions → `shared/utils.js`
- Modify state structure → `shared/state.js`
- App initialization → `app.js`
- **UI/Rendering/Navigation ONLY** → `index.html`

**⚠️ Remember: Business logic goes in components, NOT index.html!**

## Common Commands
- Test: `npm test`
- Test with coverage: `npm test:coverage`
- Serve locally: `firebase emulators:start`
- Deploy: `firebase deploy` (NOT npm run deploy)
- Git commands: Use WSL (e.g., `wsl git status`)

## Git Workflow Checklist
1. ✅ Create feature branch: `wsl git checkout -b feature-name`
2. ✅ Make changes and commit: `wsl git commit -m "description"`
3. ✅ Push: `wsl git push origin feature-name`
4. ✅ Deploy branch to production: `firebase deploy`
5. ✅ Test manually on production (deployed branch)
6. ✅ Verify all functionality works in production
7. ⏸️ Wait for user to approve merge to main
8. ✅ After approval, merge to main
9. ✅ Deploy main branch: `firebase deploy`

## Complete Development Cycle Example
```bash
# Start new feature
wsl git checkout -b add-client-search

# Make changes, code the feature
# ... edit files ...

# Commit changes
wsl git add .
wsl git commit -m "Add client search functionality"
wsl git push origin add-client-search

# Deploy feature branch to production for testing
firebase deploy

# Manual testing on production
# - Open production URL
# - Test client search feature
# - Verify it works correctly
# - Check for any bugs

# If tests pass, ready for merge
# Wait for user approval

# After user approval
wsl git checkout main
wsl git merge add-client-search
wsl git push origin main

# Deploy stable main branch
firebase deploy
```

## Key Reminders
- This is a modular system designed to avoid merge conflicts. Keep features in their respective component files!
- Business logic belongs in components, NOT in index.html (Apply Intelligently)
- index.html is for UI, rendering, and navigation only
- NEVER commit directly to main branch
- ALWAYS wait for user approval before merging to main
- Footer must show version and branch name
