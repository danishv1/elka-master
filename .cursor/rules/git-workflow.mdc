# Git Workflow - CRITICAL RULES

- ❌ NEVER make changes directly to `main` branch
- ✅ ALWAYS start a new branch for any changes
- ✅ Branch naming: descriptive-feature-name (e.g., `settings-fix`, `add-client-search`, `order-pdf-update`)
- ✅ ALWAYS merge to main ONLY when the user explicitly instructs
- ⚠️ Wait for user approval before merging any branch to main
- Use WSL for all git operations (e.g., `wsl git checkout -b feature-name`)
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Write descriptive commit messages in English
- Update CHANGELOG.md for significant changes
- Don't commit node_modules or sensitive files
- Create feature branches from main
- Test thoroughly before requesting merge

## Git Command Examples
- Create branch: `wsl git checkout -b feature-name`
- Add files: `wsl git add .`
- Commit: `wsl git commit -m "description"`
- Push: `wsl git push origin feature-name`
