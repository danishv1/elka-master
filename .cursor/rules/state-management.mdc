# State Management

## Centralized State
- All state is managed in `shared/state.js`
- Never create duplicate state objects
- Always use the shared state instance
- Update state before calling `render()`

## State Update Pattern
```javascript
// Read state
const currentClient = state.selectedClient;

// Update state
state.view = 'projects';
state.selectedClient = clientId;

// Always render after state changes
render();
```
